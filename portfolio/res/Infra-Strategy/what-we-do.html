    		<h2>what we do</h2>
        	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>nfra-Strategy provides the talent, tools and technology to help customers improve their operations, save money and grow their business. We offer a full suite of services, from marketing to management, that allow small and midsized professional service firms to focus on delivering client value while we lighten the load of running the business.</p>
			<p>Many of our services are available a la carte but designed to be most effective in conjunction with each other. For example, our Legal Lead Generation services are powerful enough, but when backed by the unmatched talent of our Call Center Team, there simply isn’t a more effective new business engine available.</p>
			<p>The breadth of our services continues to evolve. We are constantly developing new tools to help our customers 1) generate new business, and 2) manage their practice more efficiently. Our passion is developing and delivering best practices across the industry; our reward is watching our customers streamline their operations, leverage our economies of scale, and achieve exponential growth. Services include:</p>
			<h4>Search Engine Marketing</h4> 
            <p>It’s one of the most powerful techniques available today to drive new business, which may explain why so many business owners squander valuable resources trying unsuccessfully to execute an online marketing plan. The Infra-Strategy Team includes experts in Pay Per Click campaigns, web design, ad copy and Search Engine Optimization to attract qualified buyers, capture their interest, and drive them to act.</p>
        	<h4>Professional Call Center</h4>
            <p>The Infra-Strategy Communications Team combines the lightning-quick efficiency of the Internet with the intimacy of a personal phone call. This highly trained team manages all inquiries, establishing a friendly yet professional customer relationship while ensuring each prospect is connected to a firm in their geography that is qualified to meet their needs. When an Infra-Strategy customer receives one of these "hot leads", they know the potential client is ready to do business.</p>
        	<h4>CRM Solutions (SaaS)</h4>
            <p>Infra-Strategy has developed customer relationship management tools (CRM) that when used in conjunction with our lead generation services, enable our customers to track and manage their prospects from the very first inquiry through case resolution. This software-as-a-service solution (SaaS) provides easy web access to a rich set of features from an intuitive dashboard. It is fully hosted and requires no installation or maintenance, freeing up valuable resources for more client-facing activity. Many customers manage their entire front office with this powerful legal industry application.</p>
        	<h4>IT Management and Risk Prevention</h4>
            <p>Infra-Strategy IT Management provides clients with ongoing IT maintenance and mitigates the risk of unplanned system outages and downtime. Our proactive approach includes routine system health checks, regular infrastructure maintenance, and recommendations to ensure your IT systems scale as your business grows.</p>
            <h4>Advanced Answering Services</h4>
            <p>Whether our clients are in court or on holiday, the Infra-Strategy Advanced Answering Service can bridge the gap to provide seamless customer service at any time of day or night. This specialized team is professionally trained to handle delicate situations, from the mundane to the complex, and provide a warm and human response during events of an urgent nature.</p>
            <h4>Legal Process Outsourcing</h4>
            <p>From legal research and drafting documents to billing and paralegal services, Infra-Strategy is the only company with both the deep technical expertise and intimate insights of running a law practice to ensure that our customers reduce costs but not the integrity of their practice.</p>
