              <li><a href="profiles-edmund-scanlan.html">Ed Scanlan</a> founds Infra-Strategy at 1846 N. Damen Ave., in his Chicago apartment above a Bucktown Italian ice stand. </li> 
              <li>Infra-Strategy moves its headquarters to downtown Chicago at 12 S. Michigan Ave., the then Chicago Athletic Association. The "<a href="images/old-office.jpg" target="_blank">office</a>" is composed of two former hotel rooms with the interior wall knocked down (by Ed) and is accessible only by crossing a boiler room, the hotel’s fire exit or a men’s locker room. Five people work for the company.</li>

              <li><a href="profiles-kevin-chern.html"> Kevin Chern </a>, previously a managing partner with the nation’s largest consumer bankruptcy firm, joins Infra-Strategy as president and Ed’s partner. At this time, the company has a dozen employees and launches TotalAttorneys.com.</li>
              <li>Infra-IT is developed, becomes a section of the company with an IT business focus and transitions from charging hourly rates to becoming a monthly service provider.</li>
              <li>For the third year in a row, both Infra-Strategy’s head count and its revenue double.</li>
            </ul>
