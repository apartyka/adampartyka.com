<h3>Edmund Scanlan, Founder &amp; CEO</h3>

<p><span id="ed"></span>Ed created Infra-Strategy from his Chicago apartment in 2002 with a credit card, a vision and the determination to create a company that people enjoy working for.</p>

<p>What started as a solo-effort Web and tech agency quickly grew to a 150+ Chicago-based workforce that unites technology, marketing and process efficiency to deliver measurable results for its clients.</p>

<p>Before Infra, Ed worked at the United Way and prominent interactive agencies where he contributed to the development of the first non-profit e-commerce application that used ACH for recurring donations.</p> 

<p>His instinct for implementing practical Internet applicants led to his work being highlighted in the Electronic Commerce Report in 1999 and invited to present at the World Electronic Commerce Conference—all by the time he was 21 years old.</p>

<p>Since Ed founded Infra, the company has consistently doubled its annual revenue and its number of employees. Ed now runs the company with his partner, <a href = "kevin_profile.html"> Kevin Chern</a>, who brings his expertise in law practice management to Infra.</p> 

<p>Today, Infra provides marketing, software and business process outsourcing services to small law firms. Infra continues to expand, providing services to more than 1,000 clients. Despite its rapid growth, the company has maintained its unique culture. </p>

<p>Ed takes pride in promoting a community office environment of entrepreneurship and ingenuity.Ed takes pride in promoting a community office environment of entrepreneurship 
    and ingenuity. As he puts it, Infra’s success has been largely due to the 
    collaboration of “incredibly talented people united in a common vision of 
    servicing clients.”</p>
