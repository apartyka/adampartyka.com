As a lawyer, he has represented thousands of bankruptcy filers and made a name for himself as an expert in law practice development.</p>
            <p>Now the President of Infra-Strategy, Kevin has again used his expertise to help the company expand from its starting core to more than 100 employees. By contributing his expertise in the areas of law practice management, marketing, business development and technology, Kevin has helped Infra-Strategy provide its clients with the support and innovation needed to stay competitive in an online market. </p>
